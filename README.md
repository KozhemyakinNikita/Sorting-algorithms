## Sorting-algorithms
# Selection and fast sort algorithms
Create a Sort class that will contain the implementation of sorts:
+ selection sort; 
+ fast sort; 

# Compare their performance on different data: 
 + fully sorted, reverse sorted, partially sorted data;
 + analyze the results of calculations;

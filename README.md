## Sorting-algorithms
# Selection and fast sort algorithms
Create a Sort class that will contain the implementation of sorts:
+ Selection Sort; 
+ Fast Sort; 

# Compare their performance on different data: 
 + fully sorted, reverse sorted, partially sorted data.
 + Analyze the results of calculations.
